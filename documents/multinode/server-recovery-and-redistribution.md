# Server Recovery and Connection Redistribution

## Overview

This document describes the server recovery detection and connection redistribution feature for OJP multinode XA deployments. When a failed OJP server recovers, the system automatically detects the recovery, invalidates stale sessions, and rebalances connections across all available servers.

## Problem Statement

In multinode XA deployments, when a server fails:
1. Connections to that server are closed
2. New connections are distributed among remaining healthy servers
3. When the failed server recovers, it remains idle (receives no connections)
4. Load imbalance becomes permanent until application restart


**Example:**
```
Initial:  Server1=10, Server2=10, Server3=10 connections
Failure:  Server2=0 (failed), Server1=15, Server3=15 (redistributed)
Recovery: Server2=0 (healthy but unused), Server1=15, Server3=15 (still imbalanced)
```

## Solution

The solution implements:
1. **Time-based health checks** - Periodically validates unhealthy servers
2. **Server recovery detection** - Identifies when failed servers become healthy
3. **XA session invalidation** - Clears stale session bindings when server recovers (XA mode only)
4. **Automatic redistribution** - Rebalances connections when servers recover (XA mode only)
5. **Balanced closure** - Fairly distributes connection closures across overloaded servers (XA mode only)
6. **Load-aware server selection** - Routes new connections to least-loaded server (XA mode only)

### XA vs Non-XA Behavior Differences

**XA Mode:**
- Uses `connectToSingleServer()` to connect to ONE server per connection
- Tracks connections via ConnectionTracker for load-aware selection
- Supports automatic redistribution when servers recover
- New connections are routed to least-loaded server
- Session stickiness: operations must use the same server as the connection

**Non-XA Mode:**
- Uses `connectToAllServers()` to connect to ALL healthy servers
- Does NOT track connections (ConnectionTracker not used)
- Does NOT support automatic redistribution
- Uses round-robin selection for all operations (not load-aware)
- Connection pools manage distribution naturally via their own logic

**Why the difference?**
- XA transactions require session stickiness to a single server
- Non-XA can use any server for any operation, so connection pools handle distribution
- In non-XA, the driver ensures all servers know about datasource config by connecting to all

## Architecture

### Components

#### 1. HealthCheckConfig
Loads configuration from `ojp.properties`:
- `ojp.health.check.interval` - How often to check unhealthy servers (default: 5000ms / 5 seconds)
- `ojp.health.check.threshold` - Min time before retrying unhealthy server (default: 5000ms / 5 seconds)
- `ojp.health.check.timeout` - Health query timeout (default: 5000ms / 5 seconds)
- `ojp.health.check.query` - Health check query (default: SELECT 1)
- `ojp.redistribution.enabled` - Enable/disable redistribution (default: true)
- `ojp.loadaware.selection.enabled` - Enable load-aware server selection (default: true, XA mode only)

#### 2. ConnectionTracker
Tracks active connections and their bound servers using `ConcurrentHashMap`:
- `register(Connection, ServerEndpoint)` - Registers new connection
- `unregister(Connection)` - Removes closed connection
- `getDistribution()` - Returns map of servers to connections (only called during redistribution)
- `getCounts()` - Returns connection counts per server

#### 3. HealthCheckValidator
Validates server health by attempting direct connection:
- Creates test connection to server
- Executes health check query (if configured)
- Returns true if server responds, false otherwise
- Closes test connection after validation

#### 4. ConnectionRedistributor
Implements balanced redistribution algorithm:
- Calculates target connections per server
- Identifies overloaded servers
- Marks connections for closure using round-robin across overloaded servers
- Logs warnings if redistribution incomplete

#### 5. MultinodeConnectionManager (Enhanced)
Integrates health check and redistribution:
- Uses `AtomicLong` timestamp for time-based triggering
- Calls `tryTriggerHealthCheck()` on each connection borrow
- Only one thread executes health check (via `compareAndSet`)
- Triggers redistribution when servers recover

#### 6. Connection (Enhanced)
Supports forced invalidation:
- `markForceInvalid()` - Marks connection for removal
- `isForceInvalid()` - Checks if marked
- `checkValid()` - Throws `SQLNonTransientConnectionException` with SQLState 08006
- `isValid()` - Returns false when marked invalid

## Flow Diagram

```
1. Application borrows connection from pool
2. MultinodeConnectionManager.connect() called
3. Check if health check interval elapsed
   ├─ No → Continue with connection
   └─ Yes → Perform health check
       ├─ Validate each unhealthy server
       │  ├─ Server responds → Mark healthy, invalidate XA sessions, add to recovered list
       │  └─ Server fails → Update last failure timestamp
       └─ If servers recovered
           ├─ XA sessions for recovered server already invalidated
           ├─ Calculate target distribution
           ├─ Identify overloaded servers
           ├─ Mark connections for closure (balanced)
           └─ Marked connections throw SQLState 08006 on next use
4. Pool detects invalid connections (via isValid() or 08006)
5. Pool closes invalid connections permanently
6. Pool creates new connections to replace closed ones
7. New connections distributed via load-aware/round-robin (includes recovered servers)
8. New connections create fresh sessions on recovered server
9. Load rebalanced!
```

### XA Session Invalidation Details

When a server recovers from failure:

1. **Detection**: Health check validates server is responding
2. **Session Invalidation** (XA mode only):
   - Identify all sessions bound to recovered server in `sessionToServerMap`
   - Remove session bindings (clears client-side cache)
   - Log invalidated sessions for debugging
3. **Result**: 
   - Old sessions can't be used (no binding exists)
   - Connection pools detect invalid connections
   - New connections create fresh sessions
   - No "Connection not found" errors

**Note**: Only affects XA mode where sessions are tracked. Non-XA mode doesn't maintain session bindings.

## Configuration

### ojp.properties

```properties
# Health check interval (milliseconds) - how often to check unhealthy servers
# Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
# Recommended: 5000-30000 (5-30 seconds) for production
# Lower values detect failures faster but increase overhead
ojp.health.check.interval=5000

# Health check threshold (milliseconds) - min time before retrying failed server
# Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
# Recommended: Match interval or slightly higher to avoid excessive retries
ojp.health.check.threshold=5000

# Health check timeout (milliseconds) - query execution timeout
# Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
# Recommended: 3000-10000 based on network latency
# If health checks frequently timeout, increase this value
ojp.health.check.timeout=5000

# Health check query - executed to validate server health
# Default: SELECT 1 (works for most databases)
ojp.health.check.query=SELECT 1

# Enable/disable automatic redistribution on recovery
# Default: true
# Set to false to disable connection redistribution when servers recover
ojp.redistribution.enabled=true

# Enable/disable load-aware server selection (XA mode only)
# Default: true
# When enabled, selects server with fewest connections
# When disabled or in non-XA mode, uses round-robin
ojp.loadaware.selection.enabled=true
```

### Database-Specific Health Queries

Default: `SELECT 1` (works for most databases)

Database-specific alternatives:
- **PostgreSQL**: `SELECT 1`
- **MySQL**: `SELECT 1`
- **Oracle**: `SELECT 1 FROM DUAL`
- **SQL Server**: `SELECT 1`
- **H2**: `SELECT 1`

## Configuration Parameters Explained

### ojp.health.check.interval

**Purpose:** Controls how often the driver checks for server recovery.

**Default:** 5000ms (5 seconds)

**When to adjust:**
- **Decrease (1000-3000ms):** For faster failure detection in dev/test environments
- **Increase (10000-30000ms):** To reduce overhead in stable production environments
- **Keep default:** For most production use cases

**Example effects:**
- `1000ms`: Health checks run frequently, server recovery detected quickly (1-2s typical)
- `5000ms` (default): Balanced - recovery typically detected within 5-10s
- `30000ms`: Lower overhead, but recovery detection takes 30-60s

**Note:** Recovery detection time = up to 2× interval in worst case (if server recovers just after a check). With 5s interval, typically 5-10s.

**Impact on system:**
- Lower values: Faster recovery, slightly higher CPU/network usage
- Higher values: Slower recovery, minimal overhead

### ojp.health.check.threshold

**Purpose:** Minimum time to wait before retrying a server that previously failed a health check.

**Default:** 5000ms (5 seconds)

**When to adjust:**
- **Match interval:** Recommended for most cases
- **Higher than interval:** If servers tend to stay down for longer periods
- **Lower than interval:** Not recommended - may cause excessive retry attempts

**Example effects:**
- `5000ms` (default): After a server fails, it won't be re-checked for 5s
- `60000ms`: After a server fails, it won't be re-checked for 60s (good for planned maintenance)

**Relationship with interval:**
- Threshold filters which failed servers to check during each health check cycle
- If threshold = interval: Failed servers eligible for retry at every check
- If threshold > interval: Failed servers wait longer before being rechecked
- If threshold < interval: Failed servers may be checked multiple times per threshold period
- Best practice: Set threshold ≥ interval to avoid excessive retry attempts

### ojp.health.check.timeout

**Purpose:** Maximum time to wait for a health check query to complete.

**Default:** 5000ms (5 seconds)

**When to adjust:**
- **Decrease (1000-3000ms):** For low-latency networks where fast response expected
- **Increase (10000-15000ms):** For high-latency networks or slow-starting servers
- **Keep default:** For most production networks

**Example effects:**
- `1000ms`: Server must respond within 1 second or marked unhealthy
- `5000ms` (default): Balanced for typical network latency
- `15000ms`: Tolerates slow networks/server startup, but slow to detect failures

**Symptoms of incorrect value:**
- Too low: Healthy servers incorrectly marked as failed due to normal latency
- Too high: Takes longer to detect genuinely failed servers

**Best practice:** Set to 2-3x your typical network round-trip time

### Configuration Examples by Scenario

**Development/Testing:**
```properties
ojp.health.check.interval=2000        # Fast detection
ojp.health.check.threshold=2000       # Quick retry
ojp.health.check.timeout=3000         # Tolerate local network
```

**Production - High Availability:**
```properties
ojp.health.check.interval=5000        # Balanced detection (default)
ojp.health.check.threshold=5000       # Match interval (default)
ojp.health.check.timeout=5000         # Standard timeout (default)
```

**Production - Stable Environment:**
```properties
ojp.health.check.interval=30000       # Lower overhead
ojp.health.check.threshold=30000      # Match longer interval
ojp.health.check.timeout=10000        # Allow for occasional slowness
```

**High-Latency Network:**
```properties
ojp.health.check.interval=10000       # Check less frequently
ojp.health.check.threshold=10000      # Match interval
ojp.health.check.timeout=15000        # Account for network latency
```

## Performance

### Overhead

**Per Connection Borrow:**
- Time check: ~50 nanoseconds
- Timestamp comparison only
- No locks, no I/O

**Health Check (every 5s by default):**
- Validates only unhealthy servers
- Single thread execution (via compareAndSet)
- ~100-300ms per server validation
- Non-blocking (doesn't affect connection attempts)

### Scalability

**XA Mode:**
- Works efficiently with 10-50 connections (typical)
- ConcurrentHashMap iteration very fast for this size
- Only iterates map during redistribution (infrequent)
- Load-aware selection adds minimal overhead

**Non-XA Mode:**
- No connection tracking overhead
- Round-robin selection is extremely fast
- Connection pools handle distribution naturally

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start 3 OJP servers
2. Create connection pool (Atomikos/HikariCP/DBCP)
3. Generate load to create 30 connections (10 per server)
4. Stop server2
5. Verify connections redistribute to server1 and server3 (15 each)
6. Wait 30+ seconds
7. Start server2
8. Verify connections rebalance after 30-60 seconds (10 per server)

### Monitoring

Check logs for:
```
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - Checking N unhealthy server(s)
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - Server <address> has recovered
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - Invalidating N XA session(s) bound to recovered server <address>
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - XA session invalidation complete for server <address>
INFO  ConnectionRedistributor - Starting connection redistribution for N recovered server(s)
INFO  ConnectionRedistributor - Redistribution complete: marked N connections for closure
```

### XA Session Invalidation Logs

When a server recovers, you'll see:
```
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - Server server1:1059 has recovered
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - Invalidating 5 XA session(s) bound to recovered server server1:1059
DEBUG MultinodeConnectionManager - Invalidated XA session abc-123-def for recovered server server1:1059
DEBUG MultinodeConnectionManager - Invalidated XA session xyz-456-uvw for recovered server server1:1059
...
INFO  MultinodeConnectionManager - XA session invalidation complete for server server1:1059. Connection pools will create new sessions.
```

If no sessions were bound (server was idle or non-XA mode):
```
DEBUG MultinodeConnectionManager - No sessions bound to recovered server server1:1059
```

### Verification Queries

```java
// Get connection counts per server
Map<ServerEndpoint, Integer> counts = 
    connectionManager.getConnectionTracker().getCounts();
    
// Check if redistribution enabled
boolean enabled = healthCheckConfig.isRedistributionEnabled();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Recovering

**Symptoms:** Server marked healthy but no connections redistributed

**Possible Causes:**
1. Health check disabled: Check `ojp.redistribution.enabled=true`
2. Threshold not met: Wait for `ojp.health.check.interval` to elapse
3. Connections in use: Wait for connections to be returned to pool
4. Pool not validating: Check pool validation configuration

**Solutions:**
- Enable logging: `log.level.org.openjproxy.grpc.client=DEBUG`
- Check configuration: Review ojp.properties
- Monitor pool: Check pool statistics

### Partial Redistribution

**Symptoms:** Warning "Redistribution incomplete: N connections not marked"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Active transactions: Connections in use can't be marked
2. Low traffic: Connections not being borrowed
3. Pool behavior: Some pools may not return connections immediately

**Solutions:**
- Wait for traffic: More borrows = more opportunities to mark
- Check transactions: Ensure transactions complete
- Increase interval: Give more time between checks

### Performance Impact

**Symptoms:** Slowdown during redistribution

**Possible Causes:**
1. Too many connections: Thousands of connections (unusual for XA)
2. Frequent health checks: Interval too short
3. Complex health query: Query takes too long

**Solutions:**
- Increase interval: `ojp.health.check.interval=60000` (60s)
- Simplify query: Use `SELECT 1` instead of complex query
- Increase timeout: `ojp.health.check.timeout=10000` (10s)

### "Connection not found" Errors After Server Recovery

**Symptoms:** After server restart, queries fail with "Connection not found for this sessionInfo"

**Root Cause:** 
- Server loses session state when killed (in-memory storage)
- Client-side session bindings persist
- Queries sent with old session UUIDs that don't exist on resurrected server

**Solution (Automatic in XA Mode):**
The system automatically invalidates XA sessions when a server recovers:
1. Health check detects server recovery
2. All sessions bound to that server are invalidated
3. Connection pools detect invalid connections
4. New connections created with fresh sessions

**Manual Verification:**
- Check logs for "Invalidating N XA session(s)" messages
- Verify XA redistributor is enabled: `manager.setXaConnectionRedistributor()`
- Ensure connection pool validates connections periodically

**For Non-XA Mode:**
Session invalidation only affects XA mode. In non-XA mode, applications should implement retry logic for transient connection errors.

## Best Practices

### Configuration

1. **Set appropriate intervals**
   - Start with 5s interval (default) for most environments
   - Increase for stable environments (10-30s) to reduce overhead
   - Decrease for testing only (1-3s for faster feedback)
   - Never set below 1 second to avoid excessive overhead

2. **Use simple health queries**
   - `SELECT 1` is sufficient for most cases
   - Avoid complex queries or large result sets
   - Ensure query executes in < 1 second
   - Don't use queries that acquire locks

3. **Match threshold to interval**
   - Set `threshold` = `interval` for most cases
   - Only increase threshold if servers tend to stay down longer
   - Never set threshold < interval

4. **Enable logging during initial deployment**
   - Set `log.level.org.openjproxy.grpc.client=INFO`
   - Monitor recovery events
   - Verify redistribution working (XA mode only)

5. **Consider your deployment mode**
   - **XA mode**: Benefits from load-aware selection and automatic redistribution
   - **Non-XA mode**: Uses round-robin, relies on connection pool for distribution

### Operations

1. **Monitor connection distribution**
   - Check logs for redistribution events (XA mode only)
   - Verify balanced distribution after recovery (XA mode only)
   - Alert on permanent imbalance
   - In non-XA mode, let connection pools handle distribution

2. **Plan for downtime**
   - Health checks will detect planned restarts
   - Redistribution automatic in XA mode (no manual intervention)
   - Expect 5-10 seconds delay for rebalancing (based on default 5s interval, worst case 10s)
   - Non-XA mode: Connection pools will naturally redistribute

3. **Test recovery scenarios**
   - Test server failure and recovery
   - Verify redistribution working (XA mode)
   - Validate performance acceptable
   - Monitor both XA and non-XA deployments separately

## Limitations

1. **XA Mode Only Features**
   - Connection tracking and load-aware selection only work in XA mode
   - Automatic redistribution only applies to XA deployments
   - Non-XA mode uses round-robin and relies on connection pools for distribution

2. **Requires connection pool validation**
   - Works with pools that validate connections (isValid() or test query)
   - Most modern pools support this (Atomikos, HikariCP, DBCP)

3. **Gradual redistribution (XA mode)**
   - Connections marked as borrowed
   - Takes time for all connections to be redistributed
   - Usually completes within few minutes under normal traffic

4. **Cannot interrupt transactions**
   - Active transactions not interrupted
   - Connection marked on return to pool
   - Ensures transaction safety

5. **Multinode only**
   - Feature only works in multinode deployments
   - Single-node deployments unaffected

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Metrics and monitoring**
   - Expose JMX metrics for redistribution
   - Track recovery success rate
   - Monitor redistribution completion time

2. **Configurable redistribution strategy**
   - Immediate (current): Close connections immediately
   - Gradual: Reduce connection lifetime gradually
   - Manual: Trigger redistribution via API

3. **Advanced health checks**
   - Execute custom health check queries
   - Validate specific database features
   - Check connection performance

4. **Admin API**
   - Manually trigger health checks
   - Force redistribution
   - View current distribution
